# Blogger
A simple blogging application built with C# + ASP.NET + Blazor

Anyone can view posts created

Users can register to create posts

Posts are written using markdown and rendered to the side of the editor to allow for live preview of the post

Once a post has been written it can be edited by the user or deleted

## Todo
There are still somethings i would like to implement
- [ ] Convert the editor to a reusable component
- [x] Add search functionality based on post title
- [ ] Add functionality to view all posts and paginate through them
- [ ] allow signed in users to leave comments on posts
- [ ] allow for authors to specify a css theme to render their posts in
